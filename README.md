# Image Captioning with PyTorch  

## üåü Project Overview  
This project explores the exciting field of **image captioning**, where computer vision meets natural language processing to generate meaningful captions for images. With a backbone of **ResNet34** and the extensive **COCO dataset**, the project aims to create a robust model capable of understanding images and describing them in natural language.  

## üîç Real-World Applications  
- **Accessibility**: Generating descriptive captions for visually impaired users.  
- **E-commerce**: Automating product tagging and description creation.  
- **Content Creation**: Enhancing social media workflows with automatic captions.  
- **Media Management**: Improving image search and categorization.  
- **Healthcare**: Assisting in medical imaging annotation.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights  
- **Model Architecture**: Utilized **ResNet34** as a feature extractor for its efficiency and performance balance.  
- **Dataset**: Trained on the **COCO dataset**, containing 400,000 images paired with five captions each.  
- **Framework**: Developed using **PyTorch**, chosen for its intuitive object-oriented programming style and flexibility.
